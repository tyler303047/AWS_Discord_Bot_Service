# AWS_Discord_Bot_Service

**This is a simple repository to use some more standardized software engineering practices to make a service backend for a discord bot using AWS**

The main specifications of this project to be implemented is as follows:
  1) A CDK to programatically define AWS resources in typescript
  2) A CI/CD pipeline to build, test, and deploy the source code into those AWS resources
  3) Source code written in Kotlin to define the decision-making and processing of the system
  4) Unit tests to test each lambda and its corresponding assumptions
  5) Integration tests to test the end-to-end computation from the user's perspective
